# Tix Demonstration Program
#
# This sample program is structured in such a way so that it can be
# executed from the Tix demo program "tixwidgets.py": it must have a
# procedure called "RunSample". It should also have the "if" statment
# at the end of this file so that it can be run as a standalone
# program.

# This file demonstrates the use of the tixBalloon widget, which provides
# an interesting way to give help tips about elements in your user interface.
# Your can display the help message in a "balloon" and a status bar widget.
