:mod:`email`: Examples
----------------------

Here are a few examples of how to use the :mod:`email` package to read, write,
and send simple email messages, as well as more complex MIME messages.

First, let's see how to create and send a simple text message:

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-simple.py


And parsing RFC822 headers can easily be done by the parse(filename) or
parsestr(message_as_string) methods of the Parser() class:

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-headers.py


Here's an example of how to send a MIME message containing a bunch of family
pictures that may be residing in a directory:

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-mime.py


Here's an example of how to send the entire contents of a directory as an email
message: [1]_

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-dir.py


Here's an example of how to unpack a MIME message like the one
above, into a directory of files:

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-unpack.py

Here's an example of how to create an HTML message with an alternative plain
text version: [2]_

.. literalinclude:: ../includes/email-alternative.py
