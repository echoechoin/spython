Several collections of example code for Tkinter.

See the toplevel README for an explanation of the difference between
Tkinter and _tkinter, how to enable the Python Tk interface, and where
to get Matt Conway's lifesaver document.

Subdirectories:

guido		my original example set (fairly random collection)
matt		Matt Conway's examples, to go with his lifesaver document
ttk         Examples using the ttk module
