Built-in Functions
==================

The Python interpreter has a number of functions built into it that are always
available.  They are listed here in alphabetical order.

In addition, there are other four built-in functions that are no longer
considered essential: :func:`apply`, :func:`buffer`, :func:`coerce`, and
:func:`intern`.  They are documented in the :ref:`non-essential-built-in-funcs`
section.

.. using :func:`dict` would create a link to another page, so local targets are
   used, with replacement texts to make the output in the table consistent

.. function:: abs(x)

   Return the absolute value of a number.  The argument may be a plain or long
   integer or a floating point number.  If the argument is a complex number, its
   magnitude is returned.


.. function:: all(iterable)

   Return ``True`` if all elements of the *iterable* are true (or if the iterable
   is empty).  Equivalent to::

      def all(iterable):
          for element in iterable:
              if not element:
                  return False
          return True

   .. versionadded:: 2.5


.. function:: any(iterable)

   Return ``True`` if any element of the *iterable* is true.  If the iterable
   is empty, return ``False``.  Equivalent to::

      def any(iterable):
          for element in iterable:
              if element:
                  return True
          return False

   .. versionadded:: 2.5


.. function:: basestring()

   This abstract type is the superclass for :class:`str` and :class:`unicode`. It
   cannot be called or instantiated, but it can be used to test whether an object
   is an instance of :class:`str` or :class:`unicode`. ``isinstance(obj,
   basestring)`` is equivalent to ``isinstance(obj, (str, unicode))``.

   .. versionadded:: 2.3


.. function:: bin(x)

   Convert an integer number to a binary string. The result is a valid Python
   expression.  If *x* is not a Python :class:`int` object, it has to define an
   :meth:`__index__` method that returns an integer.

   .. versionadded:: 2.6


.. class:: bool([x])

   Return a Boolean value, i.e. one of ``True`` or ``False``.  *x* is converted
   using the standard truth testing procedure.  If *x* is false or omitted, this
   returns :const:`False`; otherwise it returns :const:`True`. :class:`bool` is
   also a class, which is a subclass of :class:`int`. Class :class:`bool` cannot
   be subclassed further.  Its only instances are :const:`False` and
   :const:`True`.

   .. index:: pair: Boolean; type

   .. versionadded:: 2.2.1

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3
      If no argument is given, this function returns :const:`False`.


.. class:: bytearray([source[, encoding[, errors]]])

   Return a new array of bytes.  The :class:`bytearray` class is a mutable
   sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256.  It has most of the usual
   methods of mutable sequences, described in :ref:`typesseq-mutable`, as well
   as most methods that the :class:`str` type has, see :ref:`string-methods`.

   The optional *source* parameter can be used to initialize the array in a few
   different ways:

   * If it is *unicode*, you must also give the *encoding* (and optionally,
     *errors*) parameters; :func:`bytearray` then converts the unicode to
     bytes using :meth:`unicode.encode`.

   * If it is an *integer*, the array will have that size and will be
     initialized with null bytes.

   * If it is an object conforming to the *buffer* interface, a read-only buffer
     of the object will be used to initialize the bytes array.

   * If it is an *iterable*, it must be an iterable of integers in the range
     ``0 <= x < 256``, which are used as the initial contents of the array.

   Without an argument, an array of size 0 is created.

   .. versionadded:: 2.6


.. function:: callable(object)

   Return :const:`True` if the *object* argument appears callable,
   :const:`False` if not.  If this
   returns true, it is still possible that a call fails, but if it is false,
   calling *object* will never succeed.  Note that classes are callable (calling a
   class returns a new instance); class instances are callable if they have a
   :meth:`__call__` method.


.. function:: chr(i)

   Return a string of one character whose ASCII code is the integer *i*.  For
   example, ``chr(97)`` returns the string ``'a'``. This is the inverse of
   :func:`ord`.  The argument must be in the range [0..255], inclusive;
   :exc:`ValueError` will be raised if *i* is outside that range. See
   also :func:`unichr`.


.. function:: classmethod(function)

   Return a class method for *function*.

   A class method receives the class as implicit first argument, just like an
   instance method receives the instance. To declare a class method, use this
   idiom::

      class C(object):
          @classmethod
          def f(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
              ...

   The ``@classmethod`` form is a function :term:`decorator` -- see the description
   of function definitions in :ref:`function` for details.

   It can be called either on the class (such as ``C.f()``) or on an instance (such
   as ``C().f()``).  The instance is ignored except for its class. If a class
   method is called for a derived class, the derived class object is passed as the
   implied first argument.

   Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods. If you want those,
   see :func:`staticmethod` in this section.

   For more information on class methods, consult the documentation on the standard
   type hierarchy in :ref:`types`.

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      Function decorator syntax added.


.. function:: cmp(x, y)

   Compare the two objects *x* and *y* and return an integer according to the
   outcome.  The return value is negative if ``x < y``, zero if ``x == y`` and
   strictly positive if ``x > y``.


.. function:: compile(source, filename, mode[, flags[, dont_inherit]])

   Compile the *source* into a code or AST object.  Code objects can be executed
   by an :keyword:`exec` statement or evaluated by a call to :func:`eval`.
   *source* can either be a Unicode string, a *Latin-1* encoded string or an
   AST object.
   Refer to the :mod:`ast` module documentation for information on how to work
   with AST objects.

   The *filename* argument should give the file from which the code was read;
   pass some recognizable value if it wasn't read from a file (``'<string>'`` is
   commonly used).

   The *mode* argument specifies what kind of code must be compiled; it can be
   ``'exec'`` if *source* consists of a sequence of statements, ``'eval'`` if it
   consists of a single expression, or ``'single'`` if it consists of a single
   interactive statement (in the latter case, expression statements that
   evaluate to something other than ``None`` will be printed).

   The optional arguments *flags* and *dont_inherit* control which future
   statements (see :pep:`236`) affect the compilation of *source*.  If neither
   is present (or both are zero) the code is compiled with those future
   statements that are in effect in the code that is calling :func:`compile`.  If the
   *flags* argument is given and *dont_inherit* is not (or is zero) then the
   future statements specified by the *flags* argument are used in addition to
   those that would be used anyway. If *dont_inherit* is a non-zero integer then
   the *flags* argument is it -- the future statements in effect around the call
   to compile are ignored.

   Future statements are specified by bits which can be bitwise ORed together to
   specify multiple statements.  The bitfield required to specify a given feature
   can be found as the :attr:`~__future__._Feature.compiler_flag` attribute on
   the :class:`~__future__._Feature` instance in the :mod:`__future__` module.

   This function raises :exc:`SyntaxError` if the compiled source is invalid,
   and :exc:`TypeError` if the source contains null bytes.

   If you want to parse Python code into its AST representation, see
   :func:`ast.parse`.

   .. note::

      When compiling a string with multi-line code in ``'single'`` or
      ``'eval'`` mode, input must be terminated by at least one newline
      character.  This is to facilitate detection of incomplete and complete
      statements in the :mod:`code` module.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3
      The *flags* and *dont_inherit* arguments were added.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6
      Support for compiling AST objects.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.7
      Allowed use of Windows and Mac newlines.  Also input in ``'exec'`` mode
      does not have to end in a newline anymore.


.. class:: complex([real[, imag]])

   Return a complex number with the value *real* + *imag*\*1j or convert a string or
   number to a complex number.  If the first parameter is a string, it will be
   interpreted as a complex number and the function must be called without a second
   parameter.  The second parameter can never be a string. Each argument may be any
   numeric type (including complex). If *imag* is omitted, it defaults to zero and
   the function serves as a numeric conversion function like :func:`int`,
   :func:`long` and :func:`float`.  If both arguments are omitted, returns ``0j``.

   .. note::

      When converting from a string, the string must not contain whitespace
      around the central ``+`` or ``-`` operator.  For example,
      ``complex('1+2j')`` is fine, but ``complex('1 + 2j')`` raises
      :exc:`ValueError`.

   The complex type is described in :ref:`typesnumeric`.


.. function:: delattr(object, name)

   This is a relative of :func:`setattr`.  The arguments are an object and a
   string.  The string must be the name of one of the object's attributes.  The
   function deletes the named attribute, provided the object allows it.  For
   example, ``delattr(x, 'foobar')`` is equivalent to ``del x.foobar``.


.. _func-dict:
.. class:: dict(**kwarg)
           dict(mapping, **kwarg)
           dict(iterable, **kwarg)
   :noindex:

   Create a new dictionary.  The :class:`dict` object is the dictionary class.
   See :class:`dict` and :ref:`typesmapping` for documentation about this class.

   For other containers see the built-in :class:`list`, :class:`set`, and
   :class:`tuple` classes, as well as the :mod:`collections` module.


.. function:: dir([object])

   Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope.  With an
   argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object.

   If the object has a method named :meth:`__dir__`, this method will be called and
   must return the list of attributes. This allows objects that implement a custom
   :func:`__getattr__` or :func:`__getattribute__` function to customize the way
   :func:`dir` reports their attributes.

   If the object does not provide :meth:`__dir__`, the function tries its best to
   gather information from the object's :attr:`~object.__dict__` attribute, if defined, and
   from its type object.  The resulting list is not necessarily complete, and may
   be inaccurate when the object has a custom :func:`__getattr__`.

   The default :func:`dir` mechanism behaves differently with different types of
   objects, as it attempts to produce the most relevant, rather than complete,
   information:

   * If the object is a module object, the list contains the names of the module's
     attributes.

   * If the object is a type or class object, the list contains the names of its
     attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its bases.

   * Otherwise, the list contains the object's attributes' names, the names of its
     class's attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its class's base
     classes.

   The resulting list is sorted alphabetically.  For example:

      >>> import struct
      >>> dir()   # show the names in the module namespace
      ['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'struct']
      >>> dir(struct)   # show the names in the struct module
      ['Struct', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__',
       '__package__', '_clearcache', 'calcsize', 'error', 'pack', 'pack_into',
       'unpack', 'unpack_from']
      >>> class Shape(object):
              def __dir__(self):
                  return ['area', 'perimeter', 'location']
      >>> s = Shape()
      >>> dir(s)
      ['area', 'perimeter', 'location']

   .. note::

      Because :func:`dir` is supplied primarily as a convenience for use at an
      interactive prompt, it tries to supply an interesting set of names more than it
      tries to supply a rigorously or consistently defined set of names, and its
      detailed behavior may change across releases.  For example, metaclass attributes
      are not in the result list when the argument is a class.


.. function:: divmod(a, b)

   Take two (non complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers
   consisting of their quotient and remainder when using long division.  With mixed
   operand types, the rules for binary arithmetic operators apply.  For plain and
   long integers, the result is the same as ``(a // b, a % b)``. For floating point
   numbers the result is ``(q, a % b)``, where *q* is usually ``math.floor(a / b)``
   but may be 1 less than that.  In any case ``q * b + a % b`` is very close to
   *a*, if ``a % b`` is non-zero it has the same sign as *b*, and ``0 <= abs(a % b)
   < abs(b)``.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3
      Using :func:`divmod` with complex numbers is deprecated.


.. function:: enumerate(sequence, start=0)

   Return an enumerate object. *sequence* must be a sequence, an
   :term:`iterator`, or some other object which supports iteration.  The
   :meth:`!next` method of the iterator returned by :func:`enumerate` returns a
   tuple containing a count (from *start* which defaults to 0) and the
   values obtained from iterating over *sequence*::

      >>> seasons = ['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter']
      >>> list(enumerate(seasons))
      [(0, 'Spring'), (1, 'Summer'), (2, 'Fall'), (3, 'Winter')]
      >>> list(enumerate(seasons, start=1))
      [(1, 'Spring'), (2, 'Summer'), (3, 'Fall'), (4, 'Winter')]

   Equivalent to::

      def enumerate(sequence, start=0):
          n = start
          for elem in sequence:
              yield n, elem
              n += 1

   .. versionadded:: 2.3
   .. versionchanged:: 2.6
      The *start* parameter was added.


.. function:: eval(expression[, globals[, locals]])

   The arguments are a Unicode or *Latin-1* encoded string and optional
   globals and locals.  If provided, *globals* must be a dictionary.
   If provided, *locals* can be any mapping object.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      formerly *locals* was required to be a dictionary.

   The *expression* argument is parsed and evaluated as a Python expression
   (technically speaking, a condition list) using the *globals* and *locals*
   dictionaries as global and local namespace.  If the *globals* dictionary is
   present and lacks '__builtins__', the current globals are copied into *globals*
   before *expression* is parsed.  This means that *expression* normally has full
   access to the standard :mod:`__builtin__` module and restricted environments are
   propagated.  If the *locals* dictionary is omitted it defaults to the *globals*
   dictionary.  If both dictionaries are omitted, the expression is executed in the
   environment where :func:`eval` is called.  The return value is the result of
   the evaluated expression. Syntax errors are reported as exceptions.  Example:

      >>> x = 1
      >>> print eval('x+1')
      2

   This function can also be used to execute arbitrary code objects (such as
   those created by :func:`compile`).  In this case pass a code object instead
   of a string.  If the code object has been compiled with ``'exec'`` as the
   *mode* argument, :func:`eval`\'s return value will be ``None``.

   Hints: dynamic execution of statements is supported by the :keyword:`exec`
   statement.  Execution of statements from a file is supported by the
   :func:`execfile` function.  The :func:`globals` and :func:`locals` functions
   returns the current global and local dictionary, respectively, which may be
   useful to pass around for use by :func:`eval` or :func:`execfile`.

   See :func:`ast.literal_eval` for a function that can safely evaluate strings
   with expressions containing only literals.


.. function:: execfile(filename[, globals[, locals]])

   This function is similar to the :keyword:`exec` statement, but parses a file
   instead of a string.  It is different from the :keyword:`import` statement in
   that it does not use the module administration --- it reads the file
   unconditionally and does not create a new module. [#]_

   The arguments are a file name and two optional dictionaries.  The file is parsed
   and evaluated as a sequence of Python statements (similarly to a module) using
   the *globals* and *locals* dictionaries as global and local namespace. If
   provided, *locals* can be any mapping object.  Remember that at module level,
   globals and locals are the same dictionary. If two separate objects are
   passed as *globals* and *locals*, the code will be executed as if it were
   embedded in a class definition.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      formerly *locals* was required to be a dictionary.

   If the *locals* dictionary is omitted it defaults to the *globals* dictionary.
   If both dictionaries are omitted, the expression is executed in the environment
   where :func:`execfile` is called.  The return value is ``None``.

   .. note::

      The default *locals* act as described for function :func:`locals` below:
      modifications to the default *locals* dictionary should not be attempted.  Pass
      an explicit *locals* dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on
      *locals* after function :func:`execfile` returns.  :func:`execfile` cannot be
      used reliably to modify a function's locals.


.. function:: file(name[, mode[, buffering]])

   Constructor function for the :class:`file` type, described further in section
   :ref:`bltin-file-objects`.  The constructor's arguments are the same as those
   of the :func:`open` built-in function described below.

   When opening a file, it's preferable to use :func:`open` instead of  invoking
   this constructor directly.  :class:`file` is more suited to type testing (for
   example, writing ``isinstance(f, file)``).

   .. versionadded:: 2.2


.. function:: filter(function, iterable)

   Construct a list from those elements of *iterable* for which *function* returns
   true.  *iterable* may be either a sequence, a container which supports
   iteration, or an iterator.  If *iterable* is a string or a tuple, the result
   also has that type; otherwise it is always a list.  If *function* is ``None``,
   the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of *iterable* that are
   false are removed.

   Note that ``filter(function, iterable)`` is equivalent to ``[item for item in
   iterable if function(item)]`` if function is not ``None`` and ``[item for item
   in iterable if item]`` if function is ``None``.

   See :func:`itertools.ifilter` and :func:`itertools.ifilterfalse` for iterator
   versions of this function, including a variation that filters for elements
   where the *function* returns false.


.. class:: float([x])

   Return a floating point number constructed from a number or string *x*.

   If the argument is a string, it
   must contain a possibly signed decimal or floating point number, possibly
   embedded in whitespace. The argument may also be [+|-]nan or [+|-]inf.
   Otherwise, the argument may be a plain or long integer
   or a floating point number, and a floating point number with the same value
   (within Python's floating point precision) is returned.  If no argument is
   given, returns ``0.0``.

   .. note::

      .. index::
         single: NaN
         single: Infinity

      When passing in a string, values for NaN and Infinity may be returned, depending
      on the underlying C library.  Float accepts the strings nan, inf and -inf for
      NaN and positive or negative infinity. The case and a leading + are ignored as
      well as a leading - is ignored for NaN. Float always represents NaN and infinity
      as nan, inf or -inf.

   The float type is described in :ref:`typesnumeric`.


.. function:: format(value[, format_spec])

   .. index::
      pair: str; format
      single: __format__

   Convert a *value* to a "formatted" representation, as controlled by
   *format_spec*.  The interpretation of *format_spec* will depend on the type
   of the *value* argument, however there is a standard formatting syntax that
   is used by most built-in types: :ref:`formatspec`.

   .. note::

      ``format(value, format_spec)`` merely calls
      ``value.__format__(format_spec)``.

   .. versionadded:: 2.6


.. _func-frozenset:
.. class:: frozenset([iterable])
   :noindex:

   Return a new :class:`frozenset` object, optionally with elements taken from
   *iterable*.  ``frozenset`` is a built-in class.  See :class:`frozenset` and
   :ref:`types-set` for documentation about this class.

   For other containers see the built-in :class:`set`, :class:`list`,
   :class:`tuple`, and :class:`dict` classes, as well as the :mod:`collections`
   module.

   .. versionadded:: 2.4


.. function:: getattr(object, name[, default])

   Return the value of the named attribute of *object*.  *name* must be a string.
   If the string is the name of one of the object's attributes, the result is the
   value of that attribute.  For example, ``getattr(x, 'foobar')`` is equivalent to
   ``x.foobar``.  If the named attribute does not exist, *default* is returned if
   provided, otherwise :exc:`AttributeError` is raised.


.. function:: globals()

   Return a dictionary representing the current global symbol table. This is always
   the dictionary of the current module (inside a function or method, this is the
   module where it is defined, not the module from which it is called).


.. function:: hasattr(object, name)

   The arguments are an object and a string.  The result is ``True`` if the string
   is the name of one of the object's attributes, ``False`` if not. (This is
   implemented by calling ``getattr(object, name)`` and seeing whether it raises an
   exception or not.)


.. function:: hash(object)

   Return the hash value of the object (if it has one).  Hash values are integers.
   They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup.
   Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value (even if they are of
   different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0).


.. function:: help([object])

   Invoke the built-in help system.  (This function is intended for interactive
   use.)  If no argument is given, the interactive help system starts on the
   interpreter console.  If the argument is a string, then the string is looked up
   as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation
   topic, and a help page is printed on the console.  If the argument is any other
   kind of object, a help page on the object is generated.

   This function is added to the built-in namespace by the :mod:`site` module.

   .. versionadded:: 2.2


.. function:: hex(x)

   Convert an integer number (of any size) to a lowercase hexadecimal string
   prefixed with "0x", for example:

      >>> hex(255)
      '0xff'
      >>> hex(-42)
      '-0x2a'
      >>> hex(1L)
      '0x1L'

   If x is not a Python :class:`int` or :class:`long` object, it has to
   define a __hex__() method that returns a string.

   See also :func:`int` for converting a hexadecimal string to an
   integer using a base of 16.

   .. note::

      To obtain a hexadecimal string representation for a float, use the
      :meth:`float.hex` method.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      Formerly only returned an unsigned literal.


.. function:: id(object)

   Return the "identity" of an object.  This is an integer (or long integer) which
   is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime.
   Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same :func:`id`
   value.

   .. impl-detail:: This is the address of the object in memory.


.. function:: input([prompt])

   Equivalent to ``eval(raw_input(prompt))``.

   This function does not catch user errors. If the input is not syntactically
   valid, a :exc:`SyntaxError` will be raised. Other exceptions may be raised if
   there is an error during evaluation.

   If the :mod:`readline` module was loaded, then :func:`input` will use it to
   provide elaborate line editing and history features.

   Consider using the :func:`raw_input` function for general input from users.


.. class:: int(x=0)
           int(x, base=10)

   Return an integer object constructed from a number or string *x*, or return ``0`` if no
   arguments are given.  If *x* is a number, it can be a plain integer, a long
   integer, or a floating point number.  If *x* is floating point, the conversion
   truncates towards zero.  If the argument is outside the integer range, the
   function returns a long object instead.

   If *x* is not a number or if *base* is given, then *x* must be a string or
   Unicode object representing an :ref:`integer literal <integers>` in radix
   *base*.  Optionally, the literal can be
   preceded by ``+`` or ``-`` (with no space in between) and surrounded by
   whitespace.  A base-n literal consists of the digits 0 to n-1, with ``a``
   to ``z`` (or ``A`` to ``Z``) having
   values 10 to 35.  The default *base* is 10. The allowed values are 0 and 2--36.
   Base-2, -8, and -16 literals can be optionally prefixed with ``0b``/``0B``,
   ``0o``/``0O``/``0``, or ``0x``/``0X``, as with integer literals in code.
   Base 0 means to interpret the string exactly as an integer literal, so that
   the actual base is 2, 8, 10, or 16.

   The integer type is described in :ref:`typesnumeric`.


.. function:: isinstance(object, classinfo)

   Return true if the *object* argument is an instance of the *classinfo* argument,
   or of a (direct, indirect or :term:`virtual <abstract base class>`) subclass
   thereof.  Also return true if *classinfo*
   is a type object (new-style class) and *object* is an object of that type or of
   a (direct, indirect or :term:`virtual <abstract base class>`) subclass
   thereof.  If *object* is not a class instance or
   an object of the given type, the function always returns false.
   If *classinfo* is a tuple of class or type objects (or recursively, other
   such tuples), return true if *object* is an instance of any of the classes
   or types.  If *classinfo* is not a class, type, or tuple of classes, types,
   and such tuples, a :exc:`TypeError` exception is raised.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      Support for a tuple of type information was added.


.. function:: issubclass(class, classinfo)

   Return true if *class* is a subclass (direct, indirect or :term:`virtual
   <abstract base class>`) of *classinfo*.  A
   class is considered a subclass of itself. *classinfo* may be a tuple of class
   objects, in which case every entry in *classinfo* will be checked. In any other
   case, a :exc:`TypeError` exception is raised.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3
      Support for a tuple of type information was added.


.. function:: iter(o[, sentinel])

   Return an :term:`iterator` object.  The first argument is interpreted very differently
   depending on the presence of the second argument. Without a second argument, *o*
   must be a collection object which supports the iteration protocol (the
   :meth:`__iter__` method), or it must support the sequence protocol (the
   :meth:`__getitem__` method with integer arguments starting at ``0``).  If it
   does not support either of those protocols, :exc:`TypeError` is raised. If the
   second argument, *sentinel*, is given, then *o* must be a callable object.  The
   iterator created in this case will call *o* with no arguments for each call to
   its :meth:`~iterator.next` method; if the value returned is equal to *sentinel*,
   :exc:`StopIteration` will be raised, otherwise the value will be returned.

   One useful application of the second form of :func:`iter` is to read lines of
   a file until a certain line is reached.  The following example reads a file
   until the :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline` method returns an empty string::

      with open('mydata.txt') as fp:
          for line in iter(fp.readline, ''):
              process_line(line)

   .. versionadded:: 2.2


.. function:: len(s)

   Return the length (the number of items) of an object.  The argument may be a
   sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection
   (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set).


.. _func-list:
.. class:: list([iterable])
   :noindex:

   Return a list whose items are the same and in the same order as *iterable*'s
   items.  *iterable* may be either a sequence, a container that supports
   iteration, or an iterator object.  If *iterable* is already a list, a copy is
   made and returned, similar to ``iterable[:]``.  For instance, ``list('abc')``
   returns ``['a', 'b', 'c']`` and ``list( (1, 2, 3) )`` returns ``[1, 2, 3]``.  If
   no argument is given, returns a new empty list, ``[]``.

   :class:`list` is a mutable sequence type, as documented in
   :ref:`typesseq`. For other containers see the built in :class:`dict`,
   :class:`set`, and :class:`tuple` classes, and the :mod:`collections` module.


.. function:: locals()

   Update and return a dictionary representing the current local symbol table.
   Free variables are returned by :func:`locals` when it is called in function
   blocks, but not in class blocks.

   .. note::

      The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not
      affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.


.. class:: long(x=0)
           long(x, base=10)

   Return a long integer object constructed from a string or number *x*.
   If the argument is a string, it
   must contain a possibly signed number of arbitrary size, possibly embedded in
   whitespace. The *base* argument is interpreted in the same way as for
   :func:`int`, and may only be given when *x* is a string. Otherwise, the argument
   may be a plain or long integer or a floating point number, and a long integer
   with the same value is returned.    Conversion of floating point numbers to
   integers truncates (towards zero).  If no arguments are given, returns ``0L``.

   The long type is described in :ref:`typesnumeric`.


.. function:: map(function, iterable, ...)

   Apply *function* to every item of *iterable* and return a list of the results.
   If additional *iterable* arguments are passed, *function* must take that many
   arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel.  If one
   iterable is shorter than another it is assumed to be extended with ``None``
   items.  If *function* is ``None``, the identity function is assumed; if there
   are multiple arguments, :func:`map` returns a list consisting of tuples
   containing the corresponding items from all iterables (a kind of transpose
   operation).  The *iterable* arguments may be a sequence  or any iterable object;
   the result is always a list.


.. function:: max(iterable[, key])
              max(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])

   Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more
   arguments.

   If one positional argument is provided, *iterable* must be a non-empty
   iterable (such as a non-empty string, tuple or list).  The largest item
   in the iterable is returned.  If two or more positional arguments are
   provided, the largest of the positional arguments is returned.

   The optional *key* argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that
   used for :meth:`list.sort`.  The *key* argument, if supplied, must be in keyword
   form (for example, ``max(a,b,c,key=func)``).

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Added support for the optional *key* argument.

.. _func-memoryview:
.. function:: memoryview(obj)
   :noindex:

   Return a "memory view" object created from the given argument.  See
   :ref:`typememoryview` for more information.


.. function:: min(iterable[, key])
              min(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])

   Return the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more
   arguments.

   If one positional argument is provided, *iterable* must be a non-empty
   iterable (such as a non-empty string, tuple or list).  The smallest item
   in the iterable is returned.  If two or more positional arguments are
   provided, the smallest of the positional arguments is returned.

   The optional *key* argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that
   used for :meth:`list.sort`.  The *key* argument, if supplied, must be in keyword
   form (for example, ``min(a,b,c,key=func)``).

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Added support for the optional *key* argument.


.. function:: next(iterator[, default])

   Retrieve the next item from the *iterator* by calling its
   :meth:`~iterator.next` method.  If *default* is given, it is returned if the
   iterator is exhausted, otherwise :exc:`StopIteration` is raised.

   .. versionadded:: 2.6


.. class:: object()

   Return a new featureless object.  :class:`object` is a base for all new style
   classes.  It has the methods that are common to all instances of new style
   classes.

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3
      This function does not accept any arguments. Formerly, it accepted arguments but
      ignored them.


.. function:: oct(x)

   Convert an integer number (of any size) to an octal string.  The result is a
   valid Python expression.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      Formerly only returned an unsigned literal.


.. function:: open(name[, mode[, buffering]])

   Open a file, returning an object of the :class:`file` type described in
   section :ref:`bltin-file-objects`.  If the file cannot be opened,
   :exc:`IOError` is raised.  When opening a file, it's preferable to use
   :func:`open` instead of invoking the :class:`file` constructor directly.

   The first two arguments are the same as for ``stdio``'s :c:func:`fopen`:
   *name* is the file name to be opened, and *mode* is a string indicating how
   the file is to be opened.

   The most commonly-used values of *mode* are ``'r'`` for reading, ``'w'`` for
   writing (truncating the file if it already exists), and ``'a'`` for appending
   (which on *some* Unix systems means that *all* writes append to the end of the
   file regardless of the current seek position).  If *mode* is omitted, it
   defaults to ``'r'``.  The default is to use text mode, which may convert
   ``'\n'`` characters to a platform-specific representation on writing and back
   on reading.  Thus, when opening a binary file, you should append ``'b'`` to
   the *mode* value to open the file in binary mode, which will improve
   portability.  (Appending ``'b'`` is useful even on systems that don't treat
   binary and text files differently, where it serves as documentation.)  See below
   for more possible values of *mode*.

   .. index::
      single: line-buffered I/O
      single: unbuffered I/O
      single: buffer size, I/O
      single: I/O control; buffering

   The optional *buffering* argument specifies the file's desired buffer size: 0
   means unbuffered, 1 means line buffered, any other positive value means use a
   buffer of (approximately) that size (in bytes).  A negative *buffering* means
   to use the system default, which is usually line buffered for tty devices and
   fully buffered for other files.  If omitted, the system default is used. [#]_

   Modes ``'r+'``, ``'w+'`` and ``'a+'`` open the file for updating (reading and writing);
   note that ``'w+'`` truncates the file.  Append ``'b'`` to the mode to open the file in
   binary mode, on systems that differentiate between binary and text files; on
   systems that don't have this distinction, adding the ``'b'`` has no effect.

   .. index::
      single: universal newlines; open() built-in function

   In addition to the standard :c:func:`fopen` values *mode* may be ``'U'`` or
   ``'rU'``.  Python is usually built with :term:`universal newlines` support;
   supplying ``'U'`` opens the file as a text file, but lines may be terminated
   by any of the following: the Unix end-of-line convention ``'\n'``,  the
   Macintosh convention ``'\r'``, or the Windows convention ``'\r\n'``. All of
   these external representations are seen as ``'\n'`` by the Python program.
   If Python is built without universal newlines support a *mode* with ``'U'``
   is the same as normal text mode.  Note that file objects so opened also have
   an attribute called :attr:`newlines` which has a value of ``None`` (if no
   newlines have yet been seen), ``'\n'``, ``'\r'``, ``'\r\n'``, or a tuple
   containing all the newline types seen.

   Python enforces that the mode, after stripping ``'U'``, begins with ``'r'``,
   ``'w'`` or ``'a'``.

   Python provides many file handling modules including
   :mod:`fileinput`, :mod:`os`, :mod:`os.path`, :mod:`tempfile`, and
   :mod:`shutil`.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Restriction on first letter of mode string introduced.


.. function:: ord(c)

   Given a string of length one, return an integer representing the Unicode code
   point of the character when the argument is a unicode object, or the value of
   the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string. For example, ``ord('a')`` returns
   the integer ``97``, ``ord(u'\u2020')`` returns ``8224``.  This is the inverse of
   :func:`chr` for 8-bit strings and of :func:`unichr` for unicode objects.  If a
   unicode argument is given and Python was built with UCS2 Unicode, then the
   character's code point must be in the range [0..65535] inclusive; otherwise the
   string length is two, and a :exc:`TypeError` will be raised.


.. function:: pow(x, y[, z])

   Return *x* to the power *y*; if *z* is present, return *x* to the power *y*,
   modulo *z* (computed more efficiently than ``pow(x, y) % z``). The two-argument
   form ``pow(x, y)`` is equivalent to using the power operator: ``x**y``.

   The arguments must have numeric types.  With mixed operand types, the coercion
   rules for binary arithmetic operators apply.  For int and long int operands, the
   result has the same type as the operands (after coercion) unless the second
   argument is negative; in that case, all arguments are converted to float and a
   float result is delivered.  For example, ``10**2`` returns ``100``, but
   ``10**-2`` returns ``0.01``.  (This last feature was added in Python 2.2.  In
   Python 2.1 and before, if both arguments were of integer types and the second
   argument was negative, an exception was raised.) If the second argument is
   negative, the third argument must be omitted. If *z* is present, *x* and *y*
   must be of integer types, and *y* must be non-negative.  (This restriction was
   added in Python 2.2.  In Python 2.1 and before, floating 3-argument ``pow()``
   returned platform-dependent results depending on floating-point rounding
   accidents.)


.. function:: print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=sys.stdout)

   Print *objects* to the stream *file*, separated by *sep* and followed by
   *end*.  *sep*, *end* and *file*, if present, must be given as keyword
   arguments.

   All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like :func:`str` does and
   written to the stream, separated by *sep* and followed by *end*.  Both *sep*
   and *end* must be strings; they can also be ``None``, which means to use the
   default values.  If no *objects* are given, :func:`print` will just write
   *end*.

   The *file* argument must be an object with a ``write(string)`` method; if it
   is not present or ``None``, :data:`sys.stdout` will be used.  Output buffering
   is determined by *file*.  Use ``file.flush()`` to ensure, for instance,
   immediate appearance on a screen.

   .. note::

      This function is not normally available as a built-in since the name
      ``print`` is recognized as the :keyword:`print` statement.  To disable the
      statement and use the :func:`print` function, use this future statement at
      the top of your module::

         from __future__ import print_function

   .. versionadded:: 2.6


.. class:: property([fget[, fset[, fdel[, doc]]]])

   Return a property attribute for :term:`new-style class`\es (classes that
   derive from :class:`object`).

   *fget* is a function for getting an attribute value.  *fset* is a function
   for setting an attribute value. *fdel* is a function for deleting an attribute
   value.  And *doc* creates a docstring for the attribute.

   A typical use is to define a managed attribute ``x``::

      class C(object):
          def __init__(self):
              self._x = None

          def getx(self):
              return self._x

          def setx(self, value):
              self._x = value

          def delx(self):
              del self._x

          x = property(getx, setx, delx, "I'm the 'x' property.")

   If *c* is an instance of *C*, ``c.x`` will invoke the getter,
   ``c.x = value`` will invoke the setter and ``del c.x`` the deleter.

   If given, *doc* will be the docstring of the property attribute. Otherwise, the
   property will copy *fget*'s docstring (if it exists).  This makes it possible to
   create read-only properties easily using :func:`property` as a :term:`decorator`::

      class Parrot(object):
          def __init__(self):
              self._voltage = 100000

          @property
          def voltage(self):
              """Get the current voltage."""
              return self._voltage

   The ``@property`` decorator turns the :meth:`voltage` method into a "getter"
   for a read-only attribute with the same name, and it sets the docstring for
   *voltage* to "Get the current voltage."

   A property object has :attr:`~property.getter`, :attr:`~property.setter`,
   and :attr:`~property.deleter` methods usable as decorators that create a
   copy of the property with the corresponding accessor function set to the
   decorated function.  This is best explained with an example::

      class C(object):
          def __init__(self):
              self._x = None

          @property
          def x(self):
              """I'm the 'x' property."""
              return self._x

          @x.setter
          def x(self, value):
              self._x = value

          @x.deleter
          def x(self):
              del self._x

   This code is exactly equivalent to the first example.  Be sure to give the
   additional functions the same name as the original property (``x`` in this
   case.)

   The returned property object also has the attributes ``fget``, ``fset``, and
   ``fdel`` corresponding to the constructor arguments.

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Use *fget*'s docstring if no *doc* given.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6
      The ``getter``, ``setter``, and ``deleter`` attributes were added.


.. function:: range(stop)
              range(start, stop[, step])

   This is a versatile function to create lists containing arithmetic progressions.
   It is most often used in :keyword:`for` loops.  The arguments must be plain
   integers.  If the *step* argument is omitted, it defaults to ``1``.  If the
   *start* argument is omitted, it defaults to ``0``.  The full form returns a list
   of plain integers ``[start, start + step, start + 2 * step, ...]``.  If *step*
   is positive, the last element is the largest ``start + i * step`` less than
   *stop*; if *step* is negative, the last element is the smallest ``start + i *
   step`` greater than *stop*.  *step* must not be zero (or else :exc:`ValueError`
   is raised).  Example:

      >>> range(10)
      [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
      >>> range(1, 11)
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
      >>> range(0, 30, 5)
      [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
      >>> range(0, 10, 3)
      [0, 3, 6, 9]
      >>> range(0, -10, -1)
      [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
      >>> range(0)
      []
      >>> range(1, 0)
      []


.. function:: raw_input([prompt])

   If the *prompt* argument is present, it is written to standard output without a
   trailing newline.  The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a
   string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. When EOF is read,
   :exc:`EOFError` is raised. Example::

      >>> s = raw_input('--> ')
      --> Monty Python's Flying Circus
      >>> s
      "Monty Python's Flying Circus"

   If the :mod:`readline` module was loaded, then :func:`raw_input` will use it to
   provide elaborate line editing and history features.


.. function:: reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])

   Apply *function* of two arguments cumulatively to the items of *iterable*, from
   left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.  For example,
   ``reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`` calculates ``((((1+2)+3)+4)+5)``.
   The left argument, *x*, is the accumulated value and the right argument, *y*, is
   the update value from the *iterable*.  If the optional *initializer* is present,
   it is placed before the items of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as
   a default when the iterable is empty.  If *initializer* is not given and
   *iterable* contains only one item, the first item is returned.
   Roughly equivalent to::

      def reduce(function, iterable, initializer=None):
          it = iter(iterable)
          if initializer is None:
              try:
                  initializer = next(it)
              except StopIteration:
                  raise TypeError('reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value')
          accum_value = initializer
          for x in it:
              accum_value = function(accum_value, x)
          return accum_value

.. function:: reload(module)

   Reload a previously imported *module*.  The argument must be a module object, so
   it must have been successfully imported before.  This is useful if you have
   edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the
   new version without leaving the Python interpreter.  The return value is the
   module object (the same as the *module* argument).

   When ``reload(module)`` is executed:

   * Python modules' code is recompiled and the module-level code reexecuted,
     defining a new set of objects which are bound to names in the module's
     dictionary.  The ``init`` function of extension modules is not called a second
     time.

   * As with all other objects in Python the old objects are only reclaimed after
     their reference counts drop to zero.

   * The names in the module namespace are updated to point to any new or changed
     objects.

   * Other references to the old objects (such as names external to the module) are
     not rebound to refer to the new objects and must be updated in each namespace
     where they occur if that is desired.

   There are a number of other caveats:

   When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the module's global
   variables) is retained.  Redefinitions of names will override the old
   definitions, so this is generally not a problem.  If the new version of a module
   does not define a name that was defined by the old version, the old definition
   remains.  This feature can be used to the module's advantage if it maintains a
   global table or cache of objects --- with a :keyword:`try` statement it can test
   for the table's presence and skip its initialization if desired::

      try:
          cache
      except NameError:
          cache = {}

   It is generally not very useful to reload built-in or dynamically loaded
   modules.  Reloading :mod:`sys`, :mod:`__main__`, :mod:`builtins` and other
   key modules is not recommended.  In many cases extension modules are not
   designed to be initialized more than once, and may fail in arbitrary ways
   when reloaded.

   If a module imports objects from another module using :keyword:`from` ...
   :keyword:`import` ..., calling :func:`reload` for the other module does not
   redefine the objects imported from it --- one way around this is to re-execute
   the :keyword:`from` statement, another is to use :keyword:`import` and qualified
   names (*module*.*name*) instead.

   If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that defines
   the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances --- they
   continue to use the old class definition.  The same is true for derived classes.


.. _func-repr:
.. function:: repr(object)

   Return a string containing a printable representation of an object.  This is
   the same value yielded by conversions (reverse quotes).  It is sometimes
   useful to be able to access this operation as an ordinary function.  For many
   types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an
   object with the same value when passed to :func:`eval`, otherwise the
   representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name
   of the type of the object together with additional information often
   including the name and address of the object.  A class can control what this
   function returns for its instances by defining a :meth:`__repr__` method.


.. function:: reversed(seq)

   Return a reverse :term:`iterator`.  *seq* must be an object which has
   a :meth:`__reversed__` method or supports the sequence protocol (the
   :meth:`__len__` method and the :meth:`__getitem__` method with integer
   arguments starting at ``0``).

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6
      Added the possibility to write a custom :meth:`__reversed__` method.


.. function:: round(number[, ndigits])

   Return the floating point value *number* rounded to *ndigits* digits after
   the decimal point.  If *ndigits* is omitted, it defaults to zero. The result
   is a floating point number.  Values are rounded to the closest multiple of
   10 to the power minus *ndigits*; if two multiples are equally close,
   rounding is done away from 0 (so, for example, ``round(0.5)`` is ``1.0`` and
   ``round(-0.5)`` is ``-1.0``).


   .. note::

      The behavior of :func:`round` for floats can be surprising: for example,
      ``round(2.675, 2)`` gives ``2.67`` instead of the expected ``2.68``.
      This is not a bug: it's a result of the fact that most decimal fractions
      can't be represented exactly as a float.  See :ref:`tut-fp-issues` for
      more information.


.. _func-set:
.. class:: set([iterable])
   :noindex:

   Return a new :class:`set` object, optionally with elements taken from
   *iterable*.  ``set`` is a built-in class.  See :class:`set` and
   :ref:`types-set` for documentation about this class.

   For other containers see the built-in :class:`frozenset`, :class:`list`,
   :class:`tuple`, and :class:`dict` classes, as well as the :mod:`collections`
   module.

   .. versionadded:: 2.4


.. function:: setattr(object, name, value)

   This is the counterpart of :func:`getattr`.  The arguments are an object, a
   string and an arbitrary value.  The string may name an existing attribute or a
   new attribute.  The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the
   object allows it.  For example, ``setattr(x, 'foobar', 123)`` is equivalent to
   ``x.foobar = 123``.


.. class:: slice(stop)
           slice(start, stop[, step])

   .. index:: single: Numerical Python

   Return a :term:`slice` object representing the set of indices specified by
   ``range(start, stop, step)``.  The *start* and *step* arguments default to
   ``None``.  Slice objects have read-only data attributes :attr:`~slice.start`,
   :attr:`~slice.stop` and :attr:`~slice.step` which merely return the argument
   values (or their default).  They have no other explicit functionality;
   however they are used by Numerical Python and other third party extensions.
   Slice objects are also generated when extended indexing syntax is used.  For
   example: ``a[start:stop:step]`` or ``a[start:stop, i]``.  See
   :func:`itertools.islice` for an alternate version that returns an iterator.


.. function:: sorted(iterable[, cmp[, key[, reverse]]])

   Return a new sorted list from the items in *iterable*.

   The optional arguments *cmp*, *key*, and *reverse* have the same meaning as
   those for the :meth:`list.sort` method (described in section
   :ref:`typesseq-mutable`).

   *cmp* specifies a custom comparison function of two arguments (iterable
   elements) which should return a negative, zero or positive number depending on
   whether the first argument is considered smaller than, equal to, or larger than
   the second argument: ``cmp=lambda x,y: cmp(x.lower(), y.lower())``.  The default
   value is ``None``.

   *key* specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison
   key from each list element: ``key=str.lower``.  The default value is ``None``
   (compare the elements directly).

   *reverse* is a boolean value.  If set to ``True``, then the list elements are
   sorted as if each comparison were reversed.

   In general, the *key* and *reverse* conversion processes are much faster
   than specifying an equivalent *cmp* function.  This is because *cmp* is
   called multiple times for each list element while *key* and *reverse* touch
   each element only once.  Use :func:`functools.cmp_to_key` to convert an
   old-style *cmp* function to a *key* function.

   The built-in :func:`sorted` function is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is
   stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that
   compare equal --- this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for
   example, sort by department, then by salary grade).

   For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see :ref:`sortinghowto`.

   .. versionadded:: 2.4


.. function:: staticmethod(function)

   Return a static method for *function*.

   A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static
   method, use this idiom::

      class C(object):
          @staticmethod
          def f(arg1, arg2, ...):
              ...

   The ``@staticmethod`` form is a function :term:`decorator` -- see the
   description of function definitions in :ref:`function` for details.

   It can be called either on the class (such as ``C.f()``) or on an instance (such
   as ``C().f()``).  The instance is ignored except for its class.

   Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. Also see
   :func:`classmethod` for a variant that is useful for creating alternate
   class constructors.

   For more information on static methods, consult the documentation on the
   standard type hierarchy in :ref:`types`.

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      Function decorator syntax added.


.. class:: str(object='')

   Return a string containing a nicely printable representation of an object.  For
   strings, this returns the string itself.  The difference with ``repr(object)``
   is that ``str(object)`` does not always attempt to return a string that is
   acceptable to :func:`eval`; its goal is to return a printable string.  If no
   argument is given, returns the empty string, ``''``.

   For more information on strings see :ref:`typesseq` which describes sequence
   functionality (strings are sequences), and also the string-specific methods
   described in the :ref:`string-methods` section. To output formatted strings
   use template strings or the ``%`` operator described in the
   :ref:`string-formatting` section. In addition see the :ref:`stringservices`
   section. See also :func:`unicode`.


.. function:: sum(iterable[, start])

   Sums *start* and the items of an *iterable* from left to right and returns the
   total.  *start* defaults to ``0``. The *iterable*'s items are normally numbers,
   and the start value is not allowed to be a string.

   For some use cases, there are good alternatives to :func:`sum`.
   The preferred, fast way to concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling
   ``''.join(sequence)``.  To add floating point values with extended precision,
   see :func:`math.fsum`\.  To concatenate a series of iterables, consider using
   :func:`itertools.chain`.

   .. versionadded:: 2.3


.. function:: super(type[, object-or-type])

   Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling
   class of *type*.  This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have
   been overridden in a class. The search order is same as that used by
   :func:`getattr` except that the *type* itself is skipped.

   The :attr:`~class.__mro__` attribute of the *type* lists the method
   resolution search order used by both :func:`getattr` and :func:`super`.  The
   attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is
   updated.

   If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound.  If
   the second argument is an object, ``isinstance(obj, type)`` must be true.  If
   the second argument is a type, ``issubclass(type2, type)`` must be true (this
   is useful for classmethods).

   .. note::
      :func:`super` only works for :term:`new-style class`\es.

   There are two typical use cases for *super*.  In a class hierarchy with
   single inheritance, *super* can be used to refer to parent classes without
   naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable.  This use
   closely parallels the use of *super* in other programming languages.

   The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a
   dynamic execution environment.  This use case is unique to Python and is
   not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support
   single inheritance.  This makes it possible to implement "diamond diagrams"
   where multiple base classes implement the same method.  Good design dictates
   that this method have the same calling signature in every case (because the
   order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts
   to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include
   sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime).

   For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this::

      class C(B):
          def method(self, arg):
              super(C, self).method(arg)

   Note that :func:`super` is implemented as part of the binding process for
   explicit dotted attribute lookups such as ``super().__getitem__(name)``.
   It does so by implementing its own :meth:`__getattribute__` method for searching
   classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance.
   Accordingly, :func:`super` is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or
   operators such as ``super()[name]``.

   Also note that :func:`super` is not limited to use inside methods.  The two
   argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate
   references.

   For practical suggestions on how to design cooperative classes using
   :func:`super`, see `guide to using super()
   <https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/>`_.

   .. versionadded:: 2.2


.. function:: tuple([iterable])

   Return a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as *iterable*'s
   items.  *iterable* may be a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an
   iterator object. If *iterable* is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged.
   For instance, ``tuple('abc')`` returns ``('a', 'b', 'c')`` and ``tuple([1, 2,
   3])`` returns ``(1, 2, 3)``.  If no argument is given, returns a new empty
   tuple, ``()``.

   :class:`tuple` is an immutable sequence type, as documented in
   :ref:`typesseq`. For other containers see the built in :class:`dict`,
   :class:`list`, and :class:`set` classes, and the :mod:`collections` module.


.. class:: type(object)
           type(name, bases, dict)

   .. index:: object: type

   With one argument, return the type of an *object*.  The return value is a
   type object.  The :func:`isinstance` built-in function is recommended for
   testing the type of an object.

   With three arguments, return a new type object.  This is essentially a
   dynamic form of the :keyword:`class` statement. The *name* string is the
   class name and becomes the :attr:`~definition.__name__` attribute; the *bases* tuple
   itemizes the base classes and becomes the :attr:`~class.__bases__` attribute;
   and the *dict* dictionary is the namespace containing definitions for class
   body and becomes the :attr:`~object.__dict__`  attribute.  For example, the
   following two statements create identical :class:`type` objects:

      >>> class X(object):
      ...     a = 1
      ...
      >>> X = type('X', (object,), dict(a=1))

   .. versionadded:: 2.2


.. function:: unichr(i)

   Return the Unicode string of one character whose Unicode code is the integer
   *i*.  For example, ``unichr(97)`` returns the string ``u'a'``.  This is the
   inverse of :func:`ord` for Unicode strings.  The valid range for the argument
   depends how Python was configured -- it may be either UCS2 [0..0xFFFF] or UCS4
   [0..0x10FFFF]. :exc:`ValueError` is raised otherwise. For ASCII and 8-bit
   strings see :func:`chr`.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0


.. function:: unicode(object='')
              unicode(object[, encoding [, errors]])

   Return the Unicode string version of *object* using one of the following modes:

   If *encoding* and/or *errors* are given, ``unicode()`` will decode the object
   which can either be an 8-bit string or a character buffer using the codec for
   *encoding*. The *encoding* parameter is a string giving the name of an encoding;
   if the encoding is not known, :exc:`LookupError` is raised. Error handling is
   done according to *errors*; this specifies the treatment of characters which are
   invalid in the input encoding.  If *errors* is ``'strict'`` (the default), a
   :exc:`ValueError` is raised on errors, while a value of ``'ignore'`` causes
   errors to be silently ignored, and a value of ``'replace'`` causes the official
   Unicode replacement character, ``U+FFFD``, to be used to replace input
   characters which cannot be decoded.  See also the :mod:`codecs` module.

   If no optional parameters are given, ``unicode()`` will mimic the behaviour of
   ``str()`` except that it returns Unicode strings instead of 8-bit strings. More
   precisely, if *object* is a Unicode string or subclass it will return that
   Unicode string without any additional decoding applied.

   For objects which provide a :meth:`__unicode__` method, it will call this method
   without arguments to create a Unicode string. For all other objects, the 8-bit
   string version or representation is requested and then converted to a Unicode
   string using the codec for the default encoding in ``'strict'`` mode.

   For more information on Unicode strings see :ref:`typesseq` which describes
   sequence functionality (Unicode strings are sequences), and also the
   string-specific methods described in the :ref:`string-methods` section. To
   output formatted strings use template strings or the ``%`` operator described
   in the :ref:`string-formatting` section. In addition see the
   :ref:`stringservices` section. See also :func:`str`.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      Support for :meth:`__unicode__` added.


.. function:: vars([object])

   Return the :attr:`~object.__dict__` attribute for a module, class, instance,
   or any other object with a :attr:`~object.__dict__` attribute.

   Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable :attr:`~object.__dict__`
   attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their
   :attr:`~object.__dict__` attributes (for example, new-style classes use a
   dictproxy to prevent direct dictionary updates).

   Without an argument, :func:`vars` acts like :func:`locals`.  Note, the
   locals dictionary is only useful for reads since updates to the locals
   dictionary are ignored.


.. function:: xrange(stop)
              xrange(start, stop[, step])

   This function is very similar to :func:`range`, but returns an :ref:`xrange
   object <typesseq-xrange>`
   instead of a list.  This is an opaque sequence type which yields the same values
   as the corresponding list, without actually storing them all simultaneously.
   The advantage of :func:`xrange` over :func:`range` is minimal (since
   :func:`xrange` still has to create the values when asked for them) except when a
   very large range is used on a memory-starved machine or when all of the range's
   elements are never used (such as when the loop is usually terminated with
   :keyword:`break`).  For more information on xrange objects, see
   :ref:`typesseq-xrange` and :ref:`typesseq`.

   .. impl-detail::

      :func:`xrange` is intended to be simple and fast.  Implementations may
      impose restrictions to achieve this.  The C implementation of Python
      restricts all arguments to native C longs ("short" Python integers), and
      also requires that the number of elements fit in a native C long.  If a
      larger range is needed, an alternate version can be crafted using the
      :mod:`itertools` module: ``islice(count(start, step),
      (stop-start+step-1+2*(step<0))//step)``.


.. function:: zip([iterable, ...])

   This function returns a list of tuples, where the *i*-th tuple contains the
   *i*-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The returned
   list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence.
   When there are multiple arguments which are all of the same length, :func:`zip`
   is similar to :func:`map` with an initial argument of ``None``. With a single
   sequence argument, it returns a list of 1-tuples. With no arguments, it returns
   an empty list.

   The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This
   makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups
   using ``zip(*[iter(s)]*n)``.

   :func:`zip` in conjunction with the ``*`` operator can be used to unzip a
   list::

      >>> x = [1, 2, 3]
      >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
      >>> zipped = zip(x, y)
      >>> zipped
      [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
      >>> x2, y2 = zip(*zipped)
      >>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2)
      True

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      Formerly, :func:`zip` required at least one argument and ``zip()`` raised a
      :exc:`TypeError` instead of returning an empty list.


.. function:: __import__(name[, globals[, locals[, fromlist[, level]]]])

   .. index::
      statement: import
      module: imp

   .. note::

      This is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python
      programming, unlike :func:`importlib.import_module`.

   This function is invoked by the :keyword:`import` statement.  It can be
   replaced (by importing the :mod:`__builtin__` module and assigning to
   ``__builtin__.__import__``) in order to change semantics of the
   :keyword:`import` statement, but nowadays it is usually simpler to use import
   hooks (see :pep:`302`).  Direct use of :func:`__import__` is rare, except in
   cases where you want to import a module whose name is only known at runtime.

   The function imports the module *name*, potentially using the given *globals*
   and *locals* to determine how to interpret the name in a package context.
   The *fromlist* gives the names of objects or submodules that should be
   imported from the module given by *name*.  The standard implementation does
   not use its *locals* argument at all, and uses its *globals* only to
   determine the package context of the :keyword:`import` statement.

   *level* specifies whether to use absolute or relative imports.  The default
   is ``-1`` which indicates both absolute and relative imports will be
   attempted.  ``0`` means only perform absolute imports.  Positive values for
   *level* indicate the number of parent directories to search relative to the
   directory of the module calling :func:`__import__`.

   When the *name* variable is of the form ``package.module``, normally, the
   top-level package (the name up till the first dot) is returned, *not* the
   module named by *name*.  However, when a non-empty *fromlist* argument is
   given, the module named by *name* is returned.

   For example, the statement ``import spam`` results in bytecode resembling the
   following code::

      spam = __import__('spam', globals(), locals(), [], -1)

   The statement ``import spam.ham`` results in this call::

      spam = __import__('spam.ham', globals(), locals(), [], -1)

   Note how :func:`__import__` returns the toplevel module here because this is
   the object that is bound to a name by the :keyword:`import` statement.

   On the other hand, the statement ``from spam.ham import eggs, sausage as
   saus`` results in ::

      _temp = __import__('spam.ham', globals(), locals(), ['eggs', 'sausage'], -1)
      eggs = _temp.eggs
      saus = _temp.sausage

   Here, the ``spam.ham`` module is returned from :func:`__import__`.  From this
   object, the names to import are retrieved and assigned to their respective
   names.

   If you simply want to import a module (potentially within a package) by name,
   use :func:`importlib.import_module`.


   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      The level parameter was added.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.5
      Keyword support for parameters was added.

..  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _non-essential-built-in-funcs:

Non-essential Built-in Functions
================================

There are several built-in functions that are no longer essential to learn, know
or use in modern Python programming.  They have been kept here to maintain
backwards compatibility with programs written for older versions of Python.

Python programmers, trainers, students and book writers should feel free to
bypass these functions without concerns about missing something important.


.. function:: apply(function, args[, keywords])

   The *function* argument must be a callable object (a user-defined or built-in
   function or method, or a class object) and the *args* argument must be a
   sequence.  The *function* is called with *args* as the argument list; the number
   of arguments is the length of the tuple. If the optional *keywords* argument is
   present, it must be a dictionary whose keys are strings.  It specifies keyword
   arguments to be added to the end of the argument list. Calling :func:`apply` is
   different from just calling ``function(args)``, since in that case there is
   always exactly one argument.  The use of :func:`apply` is equivalent to
   ``function(*args, **keywords)``.

   .. deprecated:: 2.3
      Use ``function(*args, **keywords)`` instead of
      ``apply(function, args, keywords)`` (see :ref:`tut-unpacking-arguments`).


.. function:: buffer(object[, offset[, size]])

   The *object* argument must be an object that supports the buffer call interface
   (such as strings, arrays, and buffers).  A new buffer object will be created
   which references the *object* argument. The buffer object will be a slice from
   the beginning of *object* (or from the specified *offset*). The slice will
   extend to the end of *object* (or will have a length given by the *size*
   argument).


.. function:: coerce(x, y)

   Return a tuple consisting of the two numeric arguments converted to a common
   type, using the same rules as used by arithmetic operations. If coercion is not
   possible, raise :exc:`TypeError`.


.. function:: intern(string)

   Enter *string* in the table of "interned" strings and return the interned string
   -- which is *string* itself or a copy. Interning strings is useful to gain a
   little performance on dictionary lookup -- if the keys in a dictionary are
   interned, and the lookup key is interned, the key comparisons (after hashing)
   can be done by a pointer compare instead of a string compare.  Normally, the
   names used in Python programs are automatically interned, and the dictionaries
   used to hold module, class or instance attributes have interned keys.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3
      Interned strings are not immortal (like they used to be in Python 2.2 and
      before); you must keep a reference to the return value of :func:`intern` around
      to benefit from it.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] It is used relatively rarely so does not warrant being made into a statement.

.. [#] Specifying a buffer size currently has no effect on systems that don't have
   :c:func:`setvbuf`.  The interface to specify the buffer size is not done using a
   method that calls :c:func:`setvbuf`, because that may dump core when called after
   any I/O has been performed, and there's no reliable way to determine whether
   this is the case.

.. [#] In the current implementation, local variable bindings cannot normally be
   affected this way, but variables retrieved from other scopes (such as modules)
   can be.  This may change.
